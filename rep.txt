REP prefix

we can create a REP prefix for some instructions that can repeat
by using one of the 4 unused IR bits. remember IR is 16 bits wide,
and we only use 12 of these bits for the actual opcode but
we fetch all of the 16 bits as an opcode from the code.

since these 4 bits are unused and left alone to cry,
we can make them happy by using them for important purposes.
the REP prefix is one of them.

the REP prefix will repeat an instruction as many times as the
count in C. so to implement this, we use one of the extra IR bits
as a REP flag, to tell whether the instruction in question
should repeat C times.

if the flag is 1, we REP, if 0 we only execute once.

we do this by using the condition evaluation circuit inside the
microcode sequencer. we route the flag from IR into this circuit,
and this will allow us to test its value.

at the end of the microinstruction block for a given repetable instruction
we create a micro-instruction of the "branch" type.

this branch type micro will test the REP flag and if the value is true,
it will take a microcode branch and go back to the beginning of the
microcode block, and re-execute the instruction.

if the flag is 0, we simply leave the instruction.
